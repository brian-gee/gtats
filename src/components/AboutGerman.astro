      More about German Gamboa
    </h1>
    <p class="text-sm text-gray-100leading-relaxed">
      Born and raised in Caracas, Venezuela, German Gamboa has always had a
      passion for the arts. He grew up with a pencil in his hand, drawing and
      scribbling ideas onto a sheet of paper. When attending college, he chose a
      degree that made the most sense to him: Graphic Design/Ilustration. Soon
      after graduating he started his career as a Tattoo Artist, and it was
      clear that he was born to do this. He is happiest when creating a unique
      piece and feeling the buzz of the machine when it inches closer to one's
      skin. Now living in Miami, Florida and doing tours around the world,
      German Gamboa spreads his creativity and love for the arts; always leaving
      behind a masterpiece. Warning: His vibes are contagious and you may seek
      more than one tattoo experience by him.
